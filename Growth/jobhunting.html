										<h2>How to land an internship - For CS Students</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										<header>
										<h3>TL;DR<h3>
											</header>
											Have a perfect resume. Then forget it, practise questions on Leetcode(>200). If you pass the coding interview,
											review course slides and your resume, tell interviewers good stories logically.
								</p>
									<p>
										<header>
										<h3>before you are invited to internview<h3>
											</header>
											<b>Your resume means everything before you are invited.</b> A lot of students especially who are used to practice with
											Leetcode usually ignore the importance of their resumes. Before you are invited to take your first interview,
											your resume means everything! Without an excellent resume, it is impossible for anyone to have
											interviews no matter how many problems they solve at Leetcode. If you don't have the confidence
											that your resume is strong enough to be considered as an candidiate, you always have change to
											improve it at anytime.

									<h3>after you are invited but before receive offers <h3>
										</header>
										<header>
										<h4>for SDE applicant <h4>
											</header>

										You may be shocked that <b>you resume means nothing once you are invited.</b> Usually there are three kinds
										of interviews before you receive offers(for new grad or junior developer), coding interviews and
										technology interviews including OO design or system design, comprehensive interviews about behavior
										questions. Prepare for them.
										<header>
										<h4>for research applicant<h4>
											</header>
										Usually it will be a round of coding interview and another round of domain knowledge based
										interview. It is also important to have a strong ability to write elegent and consise codes
										during the interviews. Ask your HR before the domain knowledge one, then prepare to review course slides, or
										think about how to explain projects on your resume. Sometimes it is a mixture exam of tech stacks they required
										and what's exactly your impact in your projects. In another word, it is better to have breadth knowledge and
										depth as well. For the breadth, you are qualified for any role or position and have the ability to switch fast
										to a new project. And for the depth, you have specific knowledge and you are a perfect match for the company.
										<header>
										<h4>What I need to do<h4>
											</header>
											<b>Practice on Leetcode.</b> High frequency and classic interview questions. <br>
											If you are research intern:<br>
											<b>Mock, tell storys of projects on resume.</b> Try to explain your projects in 10mins, 5mins and 3mins. <br>
											<b>Review course slides.</b> Ask HR before. And always review OS.
										</p>
										<p>
											<header>
											<h3>Team match and behavior questions<h3>
												</header>
												Personally I don't have BQ interviews before. I think they all need strong communication skills, to understand
												and response quickly. I will finish this part in following months.
